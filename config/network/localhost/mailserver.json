        "body": "At 0800 hours today, DPEI received an emergency call from Dr. Fritz Strickland, one of two full-time physicians at Hudson's Well Catholic Hospital. In less than 24 hours, eight patients have been admitted, with suspect symptoms, including two medical staff, and four of those have died. High fever is universal, and intense headaches are also reported, along with coughing, nausea, disorientation, and hallucinations.  Dr. Strickland has isolated the patients and is requesting immediate assistance.  All patients have proven resistant to antibiotics including Cefepime, Levequin, and Vancomycin. Tylenol failed to reduce their fevers, and cooling blankets were only marginally effective.  The responders named below are to proceed immediately to Hudson's Well Catholic Hospital, identify the illness, set a treatment plan, locate the source of the infection, evaluate the crisis, and advise on contagion and containment.  --SM, M.D."
